# Microwave Analog Frontend Design and Simualtion
- This directory contains a number of design and simulation of circuits that I learnt as a part of the Microwave Analog Frontend course part1 that I took at the University of Stuttgart offered by the ILH Institute
- Throughout all the simulations I have used Keysight ADS software and have utilized the Nonlinear DemoKit that comes along with the software.
